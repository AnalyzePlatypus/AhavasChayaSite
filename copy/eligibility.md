### How funding works

The parent will be responsible for a percentage of the provider's fee. This percentage will be determined upon approval of this application.

Ahavas Chaya generally covers 75% of the cost.
Ahavas Chaya does not pay the provider until the family has paid its pre-arranged share.

#### How payment works

Ahavas Chaya approves only several sessions at a time.

When student is approved for funding the mental health provider will receive a direct  email confirmation of Ahavas Chaya's responsibility to them. 

After each approved session, the provider should directly invoice Ahavas Chaya.
The family should then pay their pre-arranged share.
After the family has paid, Ahavas Chaya will pay the remaining percentage.

The Mental Health Provider bills should indicate the parent's responsibilities and reflect the parent's payments as well.

When we are billed for approved sessions, we will then email the provider notification for additional approval. The parents may opt to receive a copy of these notifications when they fill out the [signup form](/apply/parents).

If the provider did not receive an email notification, please have the school faculty member follow up with Ahavas Chaya.

**Ahavas Chaya will not be responsible for any bills for which the provider did not receive email confirmation!**

Finally, Ahavas Chaya is only responsible for bills submitted within 6 weeks of treatment.
