Ahavas Chaya was founded with the intention of furthering mental health awareness across Jewish communities. 

Our primary focus is to provide financial assistance for therapy to children living in single-parent homes. Many children living in these circumstances don’t have the resources or funding to access the proper help. 

Ahavas Chaya works together with educational Institutions and various organizations to identify these children and help guide them towards the proper professionals. 

[With your help](/donate) we hope to reach as many children as possible and bridge the gap between struggling children and mental health professionals, working to create a sustainable and successful future for our communities.
